How to remove the TPS (Terminal Protection Software)


you need to go into your home dir (~/) and edit the hidden file .bashrc using your favorite text editor.
In the file you need to remove the following lines:

===================================================
#Kill Switch, will be activated when ctrl+c is pressed (Sometimes the chromebooks need to be powerwashed or reset by a recovery to make QGIS work after this)
# trap ctrl-c and call ctrl_c()
trap ctrl_c INT

function ctrl_c() {
        echo "** Nice try!" && exit
}

for i in `seq 1 5`; do
    sleep 1
    echo -n "."
done

tput reset
tput setaf 2; echo "OnTheLink - TERMINAL PROTECTION SOFTWARE"
sleep 1
tput setaf 6; echo "Checking for updates..."
sleep 2
tput setaf 5; echo "No updates found!"
tput setaf 3; echo "Checking terminal protection config file...."
sleep 1
tput setaf 1; echo "You do NOT have the permission to use the terminal! Closing in 4 seconds..."
sleep 1
tput setaf 1; echo "3"
sleep 1
tput setaf 1; echo "2"
sleep 1
tput setaf 1; echo "1"
sleep 1
tput setaf 2; echo "Goodbye!"
sleep 1
exit
===================================================
After removing those lines you can save the file and exit
