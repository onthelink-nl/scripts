Hi,

Welcome to our scripts repo!
I guess you are reading this file because you want to contribute to the project and make some changes if required..
You can and are allowed to change the code and scripts and send us a pull request so we can commit the changes you made.


There are just a few things you need to know:
1. You cannot just fork the project and claim it as yours (please put the original creators names in your fork (that means us) and it will be fine)
2. Do not put any dangerous code in the scripts (so no virus, malware and absolutely no removing the boot files of the user's os)
3. Try to be friendly to other contributers.
4. Please make your code as understandable as possible (so other contributers can see what they are actually working on)

That's everything for now!


Have fun contributing,

Greetings,
Team OnTheLink
